# ProtocoltoPort-Dictionary

This program was built as a study help for myself while trying to memorize various protocols and their corresponding default port numbers.
Instead of pulling out my phone or web browser and googling which port belongs to a certain protocol every time I fail to remember, I can instead
run this program.
The program asks what protocol you want to know the port number to, and after your input, the program prints which port number(s) that protocol belongs to.
The information on port numbers and protocols is located within the "Protocols_dict.txt" file.
Ex. 'FTP' '21'

The program is also able to add to the dictionary new protocols/ports upon request, or if a protocol is input that the dictionary doesn't contain.
You can configure the dictionary outside of the program if you wish by accessing the "Protocols_dict.txt" file and modifying the dictionary that way.

In the programs current state, it doesn't identify whether the port numbers are UDP or TCP, only the actual number.
I plan to update this into the program later, and also make it more streamlined.
